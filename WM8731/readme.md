# WM8731 audio codec library

This is an Arduino library for the Wolfson WM8731 audio codec.

Status:

* EXPERIMENTAL.  May not work.
* Control interfaces only.  No audio interfaces are implemented yet.  Eventually this should have [or link with] audio interfaces using SPI (for regular arduino) and I2S (for Teensy 3.0).
